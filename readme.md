List of recommended browsers :
Although the npm start command will open a window in the browser that is set default on
your machines the following is a list of browsers that we recommend you to open the
localhost at :
1) Brave
2) Firefox
3) Safari
Although chrome works as well sometimes there is a cors issue while communicating
between inter port processes as we have and so we do not advise using it to test the
application.
